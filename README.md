# Smart Irrigation System (AquaSense)

## Project Overview

The **Smart Irrigation System** is an IoT-enabled solution designed to monitor soil moisture and light levels, automate water delivery, and provide both offline and online control for small- to medium-scale gardens. The system combines Arduino-based sensing and control with ESP8266 WiFi connectivity and the Blynk cloud platform, allowing real-time remote monitoring and manual override via a mobile app.

Key features:

- Real-time soil moisture and light monitoring.
- Automatic irrigation with threshold-based logic.
- Local display via I2C LCD for offline operation.
- Remote monitoring and control using Blynk cloud.
- Token-based authentication ensuring secure cloud interaction.
- Buzzer and LED alerts for abnormal conditions (e.g., dry soil).
